Do I __program__? Sure I do. Here's a *snippet* of my latest ~~copy-paste from StackOverflow~~ entirely self-written code:
```
while(low <= high){
  int mid = (high - low / 2)
  if(arr[mid] > val)
  // do something here...
  // you thought i knew binary search pseudocode by heart? nice try
```

In the meantime, here's an inspirational quote: `whatever you are, be a good one` - Abraham Lincoln.
